## Source files

This folder stores executable Python files called by the main files.

This includes:
* picture_stuff.py -- Library of impored functions used by the display routines.
* Lego_exploratory.py -- An unrelated file which was used to do preliminary
  data exploration on some of the databases available, including those from
  rebrickable.com.

Also included:
* Lego_Exploratory_Data_Analysis.ipynb -- a Jupyter notebook which loads the
  rebrickable.com data and messes around with it.  Needed as part of the
  rest of the package, but interesting to look through.
* Photo_lego_pipeline_repeats.ipynb -- a Jupyter notebook used to take photos
  for training the model.
