## Source files

This folder stores all executable Python and Jupyter notebook files.

This includes:

* load_model_and_go.py -- Currently running this file does everything.

* load_model_and_GO_from_py_files.ipynb -- a Jupyter notebook echoing much
  of the functional code of load_model_and_go.py.

* picture_stuff.py -- Library of impored functions used by the display routines.

* Lego_exploratory.py -- An unrelated file which was used to do preliminary
  data exploration on some of the databases available, including those from
  rebrickable.com.
