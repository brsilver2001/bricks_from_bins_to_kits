# bricks_from_bins_to_kits

Teaching a convolutional neural network through Keras &amp; TensorFlow to
identify pictures from a mixed bin of Lego bricks and create an inventory
of ID numbers to associate them with their original kits.

### Calculation resources for the 3 incarnations of the application

J - Jupyter notebook version
P - Python ".py" version running and displaying on same computer
A - Application to be executed remotely in server-client relationship

* Python
    * matplotlib
    * numpy
    * PIL (Python image library)

* TensorFlow neural networks
    * Keras front end
    * Inception V3 partially pre-trained model

* Javascript sources for "A" version only
    * ??


### Data resources
There are a number of places on the web where one can get pictures of Lego
bricks if you know their ID number.  For example:
  * lego.com - Includes pick-a-brick and Lego Digital Designer
  * rebrickable.com - A database updated monthly of their inventory and
        relationships between brick ID numbers and kits
  * more stuff here

There are also a number of places where you can get the lego ID numbers if you
know the name and number of a kit.  For example:
  * someplace
  * someplace else
