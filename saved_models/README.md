## Saved Models

This folder contains the trained convolutional neural net models which
are the core of the classifier system.  There is one set for color images
and another for grayscale.

At this time, the saved models are .h5 files from the Keras-TensorFlow
system, and are too big to upload to GitHub.  What I might do is provide a
pointer to the untrained model and all the data and code to duplicate
my training of it.


Also saved in this folder at pickled label dictionaries. These connect the
indices of the model outputs to brick name labels.
